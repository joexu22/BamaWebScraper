**Bama Course Equivalency WebScraper** is a web-scraping project which allows an University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa student to check where in the country they can take a course, without having to be at Bama. This project was brought about by a personal desire to not return to Bama just for a specific class.

## How To Use?

This **WebScraping** service is currently under construction...<br>

Installation is an issue. TODO: Port this onto a docker image

Currently
1. pip3 install selenium
2. pip3 install pyvirtualdisplay
3. pip3 install bs4

It will be made available once the product is finished. The idea is that the user can simply enter in the course ID for the Bama class and it will automatically search for all relevant classes in the country, as listed on the equivalency table.
