# Beautiful Soup as a Web-Scraping Tool

Admittedly this is a code graveyard.
I guess I wrote the original here as a way of going through the BeautifulSoup documentation.
From the hints, given in the code, I assume that there was some book related to Packet Publishing that I used as a template.
In any case, I am here to revive some dead code.


Note To Self -
    My coding skills do not seem to be all that better than from before
    At least I can now sniff out bad code.
